# Transform Blueprints to Code in Seconds. Not Hours.

**Node to Code** transforms your Unreal Engine Blueprint graphs into clean, structured C++ with a single click. Stop spending hours on tedious manual conversions, struggling to explain complex visual logic, or navigating sprawling Blueprint systems. This LLM-powered plugin bridges the Blueprint-to-code gap, whether you're optimizing performance, improving collaboration, or learning/teaching the Unreal Engine C++ API.

## üîç Why Node to Code?

### üí¨ **Blueprint Communication Solved**
- üÜï Support for Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Flash, & OpenAI's latest models
- üÜï Support for LM Studio -> [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/protospatial/NodeToCode/wiki/LM-Studio-Quick-Start)
- **Pseudocode Translation:** Convert Blueprints into universally understandable pseudocode
- **Automatic Translation Saving:** Each translation is saved locally for easy archiving & sharing via chat or docs
- Share complete Blueprint logic as text in forums, chat, emails, or documentation
- No more endless screenshot chains or lengthy meetings to explain systems
- Perfect for remote teams, forum help requests, and collaborating with AI assistants

### üß≠ **Navigate Complex Blueprint Architectures**
- Transform sprawling node networks into clear, structured text
- Capture entire Blueprint hierarchies with configurable depth (up to 5 levels deep)
- Spot patterns and relationships that are hidden in visual spaghetti

### üß† **Bridge Blueprint to C++ Knowledge**
- See your own Blueprint logic translated to proper Unreal C++
- Learn from implementation notes that explain key concepts and patterns
- Use your existing code as reference to influence translation style
- Compare multiple language outputs (C#, JavaScript, Python, Swift) to strengthen programming fundamentals

### ‚ö° **Performance When You Need It**
- Quickly translate performance-critical Blueprint systems to C++
- Keep prototyping rapidly in Blueprint, knowing you can convert bottlenecks later
- Avoid the tedious manual conversion process that takes hours or days

### üìö **Built-in Documentation & Knowledge Preservation**
- Create searchable text archives of your Blueprint systems
- Preserve design decisions in formats accessible to everyone on your team
- Generate code snippets for technical documentation or requirements

## üîß Under the Hood

- **Blueprint Analysis:** Captures your entire Blueprint graph structure, including execution flows, data connections, variable references, and comments
- **Multiple LLM Options:** Use cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, DeepSeek) or run 100% locally via Ollama for complete privacy
- **Efficient Serialization:** Converts blueprints into a bespoke JSON schema that reduces token usage by 60-90% compared to UE's verbose Blueprint text format
- **Style Guidance:** Supply your own C++ files as reference to maintain your project's coding standards and patterns
- **Integrated Editor Experience:** Review translations in a dockable Unreal editor window with syntax highlighting, implementation notes, & theming

## üë• Value for Your Entire Team

- **Blueprint Creators:** Communicate systems clearly and gradually learn C++ through your own work
- **C++ Programmers:** Understand designer intent without deciphering complex visual graphs
- **Project Leads:** Improve team communication and maintain better system documentation
- **Educators & Students:** Bridge the visual-to-code learning gap with real examples
